x-board-package
===============

This package is meant to be an easy way to install the x-board toolchain. 
It is merely a temporary package because it is meant to be replaced by 
debian packages.

This package is released under the GPL (See license). If you are interested
in modifying any of these files, all of the original work (including sources
of what you can only find compiled binaries of here) can be found in one of
the other repositories, where it is generally licensed more liberally.
